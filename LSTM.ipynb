Susan Collins being bribed to vote against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh ? That \\u2019 s what she and others are saying .\\nThe conservative-leaning news site Newsmax reported on Monday that a prominent Republican elections lawyer is calling for an investigation into what it described as a more than $ 1 million \\u201c threat \\u201d hanging over Collins \\u2019 s head , depending on her vote on Kavanaugh . In a statement to Newsmax , Collins said she believed there was an attempt to \\u201c bribe \\u201d her vote and said she wouldn \\u2019 t be the target of \\u201c quid pro quo fundraising . \\u201d\\nBut no one is actually trying to give Collins money to vote against Kavanaugh .\\nInstead , what Newsmax and Collins are referring to is a crowdfunding campaign run on the progressive political crowdfunding platform Crowdpac . Launched by ALS patient and activist Ady Barkan , the grassroots community action organization Maine People \\u2019 s Alliance , and the activist and watchdog group Mainers for Accountable Leadership , the campaign is meant to encourage Collins to vote against Kavanaugh .\\nIt \\u2019 s raised $ 1.1 million so far , but that money will never go to Collins . The proposition : If Collins votes against Kavanaugh , donors who have pledged to the campaign won \\u2019 t be charged . If she votes for him , the funds raised will go to her Democratic opponent when she is up for reelection in 2020 .\\nI may be losing my voice , but I can still send a message , and I have one for @ SenatorCollins :\\nIf you vote for Kavanaugh we will fund your future opponent for 2020 . Vote NO and # StopKavanaugh # BeAHero\\nPledge $ 20.20 to this campaign and share it : https : //t.co/4HPtATVrXc pic.twitter.com/ZkdI3u57yY \\u2014 Ady Barkan ( @ AdyBarkan ) August 16 , 2018\\nCollins and Alaska \\u2019 s Sen. Lisa Murkowski are considered to be the two key votes on Kavanaugh who will determine whether he is confirmed as a justice of the US Supreme Court . Both women are in favor of abortion rights , and progressives have been pushing them fiercely to oppose Kavanaugh \\u2019 s nomination because of concerns over his stance on Roe v. Wade and the possibility that he might vote to overturn or chip away at the landmark case .\\nKavanaugh and Collins met in August , and she said he told her that the matter was \\u201c settled law , \\u201d even though , as \\u2588\\u2588\\u2588 \\u2019 s Anna North pointed out , during his confirmation hearing last week , Kavanaugh largely danced around giving a straight answer on the issue .\\nThere \\u2019 s some back-and-forth over the legality of the crowdfunding campaign\\nAt issue here is whether Collins is being , essentially , paid for her vote . As mentioned , the crowdfunding campaign isn \\u2019 t promising a donation to her campaign , but if she votes no , it would give money to her eventual opponent .\\nT.J. Adams-Falconer , a spokesperson for Crowdpac , told Newsmax that the platform had been \\u201c thoroughly vetted \\u201d by the Federal Election Commission and had received \\u201c unanimous approval \\u201d from it . He said Barkan , the progressive activist who created the campaign , and his Be a Hero PAC have selected a nominee fund for the pledges if they become contributions that will go toward Collins \\u2019 s eventual opponent , which , he said , is legal .\\nIn an emailed statement to \\u2588\\u2588\\u2588 , Adams-Falconer said the response to the campaign has been \\u201c incredible \\u201d and an example of tens of thousands of people expressing their political speech and \\u201c counteracting the dark money that has poured in from big , corporate groups \\u201d for years . \\u201c The notion that this grassroots activism amounts to bribery is ridiculous and insulting to the more than 40,000 Mainers and other Americans who are making their voice heard through this campaign \\u2014 no matter which way she votes , Senator Collins will not receive anything of value from this campaign , \\u201d he said .\\nDespite Crowdpac \\u2019 s defense , the Wall Street Journal \\u2019 s editorial board jumped onto the bribery bandwagon on Tuesday , saying the campaign is clear \\u201c quid pro quo \\u201d and questioning its legality . \\u201c We \\u2019 re all for citizens exercising their free-speech rights , including campaign donations , for or against political candidates , \\u201d the board wrote . \\u201c But federal law defines the crime of bribery as \\u2018 corruptly \\u2019 offering \\u2018 anything of value to a public official , including a Member of Congress , with the intent to \\u2018 influence any official act . \\u2019 \\u201d\\nCollins told the Journal that three attorneys had told her it \\u2019 s a \\u201c clear violation \\u201d of federal law . In the same interview , she also complained about \\u201c out-of-state voicemails \\u201d being left on answering machine in her offices . Activists have also mailed her wire hangers , referencing a dangerous abortion method women sometimes resort to when the medical procedure is illegal .\\nSome progressives have pointed out that while many on the right are complaining about the grassroots crowdfunding campaign around Collins as bribery , they seem to have no such qualms about campaign donations from major corporations or billionaires such as the Koch brothers , which are completely legal under campaign finance laws .\\n`` I much prefer to get bribes from the Koch Brothers and other right-wing billionaires , '' @ SenatorCollins continued ( probably ) https : //t.co/LW2IVfY3re \\u2014 Tommy Vietor ( @ TVietor08 ) September 11 , 2018\\nSusan Collins is complaining about citizen participation in democracy .

But whether it \\u2019 s actually a bribe isn \\u2019 t really clear .\\nAs mentioned , the campaign isn \\u2019 t offering to pay her if she votes no \\u2014 if she does , everybody just gets their money back . If she votes yes , the money will eventually go to her Democratic challenger , but that \\u2019 s conceivably not all that different from any other grassroots political campaign .\\nBeyond Collins , crowdfunding has been on the rise in politics .\\nThere are dozens of campaigns listed on the Crowdpac website right now , including fundraisers for specific candidates , committees , and causes . One campaign is aimed at helping potential voters get money so they can get identification to vote . Another appears to be run by Arnold Schwarzenegger in an effort to combat gerrymandering .\\n\\u201c Basically , anything that \\u2019 s in the news right now is getting a tremendous response with social media and crowdfunding , \\u201d Jesse Thomas , the acting CEO of Crowdpac , recently told me . \\u201c And the attention is really being monetized . \\u201d\\nCase in point : When I spoke with Thomas late last month , the Collins-pegged crowdfunding campaign had raised $ 150,000 . It \\u2019 s now at more than $ 1 million .\\nMultiple figures who have been spurned by President Donald Trump have had success in the crowdfunding realm this year , including Stormy Daniels , Andrew McCabe , Peter Strzok , and Michael Cohen . McCabe , Strzok , and Cohen ran their campaigns on GoFundMe ; Daniels , whose real name is Stephanie Clifford , used CrowdJustice , a fundraising website aimed at raising money for legal matters .\\nIn the current environment , many Americans are looking to get involved in the political system any way they can \\u2014 by voting , by protesting , by calling , and , yes , by donating their money .\",\n          \"( CNN ) President Donald Trump has reason to hope his luck is changing after a long legal losing streak .\\nTrump got to celebrate a big win Wednesday in an emoluments clause case relating to his Washington hotel . And there are signs that a case in Louisiana could cause yet another near death experience for Obamacare , his predecessor 's top domestic achievement .\\nThe courtroom action this week represents a potential reversal of fortune for Trump following a long list of defeats the President has tasted on cases from immigration to the 2020 census to his efforts to thwart Democratic oversight to his central campaign promise to build a border wall . For a man who bills himself as one of life 's ultimate winners , Trump 's legal losing record is a branding nightmare .\\nYet the intimate relationship between this President and the courts actually goes beyond the win-loss calculation that normally powers Trump 's life . The judicial system serves multi-dimensional roles for Trump in his personal , business and Washington life .\\nWhile the law has often frustrated Trump 's political goals , he has still used it as a weapon to combat Democrats , as the glue in his conservative coalition and to postpone threatening political crises .\\nOften -- as in the case of Trump 's national emergency declaration designed to fund his border wall or the census -- it seems as if the long odds in court do not deter the President . The law gives Trump another venue for the endless fights that sustain his politics and his personality . Even if he loses he is showing his supporters he 's never giving up the battle .\\nTrump 's judicial appointments are likely to shape the character of American life for years after he 's left the White House . And it 's still possible court rulings could pose an existential threat to his personal and business legacy given the flurry of cases currently open in New York .\\nAs is often the case , Trump 's wins in the courts have been outnumbered by his losses this week .\\nThe administration has just tumbled to defeat before different judges -- including in the Supreme Court -- on its attempts to place a citizenship question on the 2020 census .\\nTwo significant court rulings in May upheld Congress in its battle to subvert Trump 's war on oversight over Democratic lawmakers ' efforts subpoena his financial records .\\nTrump has also tasted defeat in huge cases on immigration -- slowing or thwarting his efforts to build his border wall , and right at the start of his term on his original travel ban . The Supreme Court has since allowed parts of a rewritten plan to stand .\\nResearch by the Center for Policy Integrity at the University of New York School of Law showed that the administration had won only three of 42 deregulatory cases , a paltry success rate of only 7 % .\\nYet Trump 's relationship with the courts is actually far more complicated than the win-loss ratio with which he judges his own success and that of everyone around him .\\nIn decades as a businessman Trump was the initiator and the target of thousands of lawsuits . He used the courts to try to extricate himself from dicey situations , as a weapon in negotiations and to test the legal limits of business practice .\\nHe used lawsuits to save face , to offer a new venue to prolong a fight , to put off a reckoning or agreed out-of-court settlements to limit the costs of personal and business liabilities .\\nAs President , Trump has also used courts to fulfill wider goals than simply winning and losing cases , especially since he 's struggled to get many major bills through Congress -- apart from a big tax reform program .\\nWith bold assertions of executive power , Trump has made the courts a constant presence in his presidency .\\nWhen he 's won , he 's trumpeted it . When -- more often -- he loses , the judgments become exhibits in his foundational political case that an elite establishment is out to get him and that he 's being treated unfairly .\\n`` So now the Obama appointed judge on the Census case ( Are you a Citizen of the United States ? ) wo n't let the Justice Department use the lawyers that it wants to use . Could this be a first ? '' Trump tweeted after a reverse in the census case on Tuesday .\\nHis frequent complaints about `` Obama judges '' reveal his view that the courts are simply an extension of the political game and earned him a rebuke from Chief Justice John Roberts .\\nAdministrations often try to achieve through the courts what they can not legislatively -- and the Trump team along with allied GOP states has been especially enthusiastic in this regard .\\nJust this week , in a hearing in New Orleans , two Republican-appointed appellate judges appeared to suggest in oral arguments that a fresh challenge to Obamacare could succeed .\\nThe case also reflects the manner in which , in an era of congressional stasis and polarization , courts are being called upon to do the job lawmakers might once have done .\\nJudge Kurt Engelhardt questioned why , after a US district judge declared the whole ACA unconstitutional , Congress did not pass a law clarifying what provisions should stay on the books .\\n`` Why does Congress want the ... judiciary to become the taxidermist for every legislative big-game accomplishment that Congress achieves ? '' Engelhardt asked .\\nThe administration 's legal gambits have often reflected the chaos and politicized arguments that rock the administration every day and have sometimes hampered its own chances of success .\\nLast week , for instance , a Justice Department lawyer admitted he had no idea what was in Trump 's mind when he suddenly reversed course on the census case on Twitter .\\nJUST WATCHED Justice Department changes step following Trump 's tweet Replay More Videos ...

Susan Collins being bribed to vote against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh?

In a statement to Newsmax, Collins said she believed there was an attempt to \\u201cbribe\\u201d her vote and said she wouldn\\u2019t be the target of \\u201cquid pro quo fundraising.\\u201d\\n\\nBut no one is actually trying to give Collins money to vote against Kavanaugh.\\n\\nInstead, what Newsmax and Collins are referring to is a crowdfunding campaign run on the progressive political crowdfunding platform Crowdpac. Launched by ALS patient and activist Ady Barkan, the grassroots community action organization Maine People\\u2019s Alliance, and the activist and watchdog group Mainers for Accountable Leadership, the campaign is meant to encourage Collins to vote against Kavanaugh.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s raised $1.1 million so far, but that money will never go to Collins. The proposition: If Collins votes against Kavanaugh, donors who have pledged to the campaign won\\u2019t be charged. If she votes for him, the funds raised will go to her Democratic opponent when she is up for reelection in 2020.\\n\\nI may be losing my voice, but I can still send a message, and I have one for @SenatorCollins:\\n\\n\\n\\nIf you vote for Kavanaugh we will fund your future opponent for 2020.

Lisa Murkowski are considered to be the two key votes on Kavanaugh who will determine whether he is confirmed as a justice of the US Supreme Court. Both women are in favor of abortion rights, and progressives have been pushing them fiercely to oppose Kavanaugh\\u2019s nomination because of concerns over his stance on Roe v. Wade and the possibility that he might vote to overturn or chip away at the landmark case.\\n\\nKavanaugh and Collins met in August, and she said he told her that the matter was \\u201csettled law,\\u201d even though, as Vox\\u2019s Anna North pointed out, during his confirmation hearing last week, Kavanaugh largely danced around giving a straight answer on the issue.\\n\\nThere\\u2019s some back-and-forth over the legality of the crowdfunding campaign\\n\\nAt issue here is whether Collins is being, essentially, paid for her vote. As mentioned, the crowdfunding campaign isn\\u2019t promising a donation to her campaign, but if she votes no, it would give money to her eventual opponent.\\n\\nT.J. Adams-Falconer, a spokesperson for Crowdpac, told Newsmax that the platform had been \\u201cthoroughly vetted\\u201d by the Federal Election Commission and had received \\u201cunanimous approval\\u201d from it. He said Barkan, the progressive activist who created the campaign, and his Be a Hero PAC have selected a nominee fund for the pledges if they become contributions that will go toward Collins\\u2019s eventual opponent, which, he said, is legal.\\n\\nIn an emailed statement to Vox, Adams-Falconer said the response to the campaign has been \\u201cincredible\\u201d and an example of tens of thousands of people expressing their political speech and \\u201ccounteracting the dark money that has poured in from big, corporate groups\\u201d for years. \\u201cThe notion that this grassroots activism amounts to bribery is ridiculous and insulting to the more than 40,000 Mainers and other Americans who are making their voice heard through this campaign \\u2014 no matter which way she votes, Senator Collins will not receive anything of value from this campaign,\\u201d he said.\\n\\nDespite Crowdpac\\u2019s defense, the Wall Street Journal\\u2019s editorial board jumped onto the bribery bandwagon on Tuesday, saying the campaign is clear \\u201cquid pro quo\\u201d and questioning its legality. \\u201cWe\\u2019re all for citizens exercising their free-speech rights, including campaign donations, for or against political candidates,\\u201d the board wrote. \\u201cBut federal law defines the crime of bribery as \\u2018corruptly\\u2019 offering \\u2018anything of value to a public official, including a Member of Congress, with the intent to \\u2018influence any official act.\\u2019\\u201d\\n\\nCollins told the Journal that three attorneys had told her it\\u2019s a \\u201cclear violation\\u201d of federal law. In the same interview, she also complained about \\u201cout-of-state voicemails\\u201d being left on answering machine in her offices. Activists have also mailed her wire hangers, referencing a dangerous abortion method women sometimes resort to when the medical procedure is illegal.\\n\\nSome progressives have pointed out that while many on the right are complaining about the grassroots crowdfunding campaign around Collins as bribery, they seem to have no such qualms about campaign donations from major corporations or billionaires such as the Koch brothers, which are completely legal under campaign finance laws.\\n\\n\\\"I much prefer to get bribes from the Koch Brothers and other right-wing billionaires,\\\" @SenatorCollins continued (probably) https://t.co/LW2IVfY3re \\u2014 Tommy Vietor (@TVietor08) September 11, 2018\\n\\nSusan Collins is complaining about citizen participation in democracy.

He couldn \\u2019 t be more wrong .\\n\\u2018 Two things form the bedrock of any open society , \\u201d Salman Rushdie once noted , \\u201c freedom of expression and rule of law . If you don \\u2019 t have those things , you don \\u2019 t have a free country . \\u201d\\nWell , in a recent Wall Street Journal op-ed , \\u201c How Free Speech Dogma Failed Us in Charlottesville , \\u201d Michael Signer , the former mayor of Charlottesville , makes the argument that restricting speech is necessary for the rule of law .\\nThe first problem with Signer \\u2019 s case is the premise itself . Sorry , but we have no uniquely pressing need to \\u201c keep pace \\u201d with violent or threatening \\u201c political disruptions. \\u201d Americans live in era of relatively little political violence . A person doesn \\u2019 t even have to go back to the brutality of the1860s and 1870s to understand this ; they can just look back at the 1960s and 1970s , or maybe even the 1990s .\\nWhen a few hundred Nazis , in a nation of 350 million , get together and march down Main Street , that isn \\u2019 t a particularly compelling reason to rethink our rights . In 1939 , well after Hitler \\u2019 s tyrannical intentions were known , 20,000 Nazi sympathizers filled up Madison Square Garden . There will always be extremists in America . Which is one reason why we must always do our best to safeguard natural rights .\\nWith white nationalists chanting \\u201c Jews will not replace us \\u201d in the streets of Charlottesville and far-left demonstrators vandalizing college campuses in response to speakers they don \\u2019 t like , we need First Amendment rules that return to common sense , not high-minded ideas that seem sound on paper but fail to keep us safe and free in practice .\\nFar-left demonstrators \\u2019 \\u201c vandalizing college campuses \\u201d in response to speakers they dislike are attempting to suppress speech , not engaging in speech . They are criminals whose actions make a great argument for free-speech absolutism and the rule of law . Does Signer believe that we should restrict speech to pacify the would-be criminal censor or placate the would-be bigot and murderer ? That would set a destructive precedent for reasons beyond protecting speech . The Nazi who rammed his car into a crowd at the \\u201c Unite the Right \\u201d rally in 2017 , murdering a woman and injuring dozens of others , was sentenced to over 400 years in jail , not given a say over how we mete out speech rights .\\nThe bottom line is that once we start creating \\u201c rules \\u201d for speech \\u2014 once we abandon the principled protection of content-neutral expression \\u2014 our words will be subjected to the vagaries of politics , the biases of voters , and the interpretations of bureaucrats . If we let subjective rules govern words , we will have undermined the entire point of constitutional governance and the Bill of Rights .\\nIt shouldn \\u2019 t need to be said that innocuous and uncontroversial speech doesn \\u2019 t require defending . Once we normalize the idea that our opinions must find a consensus to be legal , we have corroded constitutional protections in an irreparable way .\\nSigner himself offers an excellent example of the inherent problems with empowering politicians to be arbiters of political expression . After the Charlottesville riot , Signer went on cable news and blamed Donald Trump and Republicans for emboldening \\u201c organized racists who caused the racially charged violence in his city over the weekend . \\u201d\\nWell , using Signer \\u2019 s standards , Trump and his supporters could be banned from political gatherings in Charlottesville . So could anyone protesting the dismantling of Confederate statues . What if one day in the future a majority in his community decides to start demolishing statues of slave-owning town founder Thomas Jefferson ? Will he ban the resulting protests ?\\nProgressive lawmakers have often tried passing laws to make it difficult for protesters to picket abortion clinics . How long before pro-life speech is labeled a dangerous impediment to \\u201c health care \\u201d and public safety ?\\nLiberal groups have long smeared organizations they dislike as \\u201c hate groups. \\u201d The Southern Poverty Law Center , for example , throws in civil-rights groups such as the Alliance Defending Freedom with white-supremacist agitators such as the Ku Klux Klan . How long before religious freedom , already declared hateful by so many on the left , is off limits ?\\nHow long before Jewish communities are allowed to ban gatherings led by Ilhan Omar , Linda Sarsour , or Louis Farrakhan ? What if enough people are convinced that the press is an \\u201c enemy of the people ? \\u201d\\nSigner , naturally , brings up Justice Robert Jackson \\u2019 s famous dissent in 1949 \\u2019 s Terminiello v. City of Chicago , in which Jackson cautioned that the Bill of Rights shouldn \\u2019 t be turned \\u201c into a suicide pact. \\u201d The \\u201c suicide pact \\u201d dissent remains a favorite of censors , gun-controllers , and others frustrated by the unpliable nature of our fundamental liberties . Yet after the majority in Terminiello found a Chicago \\u201c breach of peace \\u201d ordinance banning speech that \\u201c stirs the public to anger , invites dispute , brings about a condition of unrest , or creates a disturbance \\u201d to be unconstitutional , Chicago did not turn to fascism . The speech at issue did not cause riots or public unrest . None of us would even be familiar with the name of the disgraced anti-Semitic priest Arthur Terminiello if it weren \\u2019 t for Jackson \\u2019 s destructive attack on natural rights .\\nEven if we conceded for the sake of argument that free speech failed Charlottesville on a single day in August of 2017 , it would be absurd to refer to the neutral view of speech enshrined by the Bill of Rights as making that document a \\u201c suicide pact. \\u201d There are millions of other places and thousands of other days where content-neutral protection of speech hasn \\u2019 t failed America . On the first anniversary of the \\u201c Unite the Right \\u201d rally in Charlottesville , only two dozen bigots showed up for a second rally in Washington , D.C. \\u2014 they had been denied a permit by Charlottesville authorities \\u2014 and they were met by thousands of counter-protesters .\\nSo Signer \\u2019 s claim that municipalities are handcuffed by free speech is risible . It \\u2019 s also irrelevant . Signer uses words such as \\u201c safe \\u201d and \\u201c safety \\u201d a dozen times in his column . The right to protest peacefully is not contingent on the actions of strangers who break the law . Just because anti-capitalists are known to occasionally throw rocks through the windows of coffee-shop chains doesn \\u2019 t mean we should be free to ban every anti-capitalist activist in the country from exercising his First Amendment rights .\\nUntil recently , we agreed on these ideals . The dogma of free speech was perhaps the only one most Americans still claimed to venerate . But that may not be the case much longer . Our support for the First Amendment seems to be waning , and if that continues , we will come to regret it .\",\n          \"On Tuesday morning , special counsel Robert Mueller \\u2019 s office released yet another indictment \\u2014 but this one was kind of a puzzler . The indictment targets Alex van der Zwaan , a Dutch attorney based in London , for making false statements to the FBI .\\nVan der Zwaan \\u2019 s connection to the Russia case runs through Rick Gates , former Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort \\u2019 s deputy whom Mueller indicted in October , along with Manafort , on charges of money laundering and illegal lobbying .\\nThe connection is convoluted , dealing with an internal Ukrainian political dispute from more than a decade ago \\u2014 but it nonetheless says some interesting things about the state of the Russia investigation right now .\\nHere \\u2019 s what the indictment says , and why it tells us something important about Mueller \\u2019 s strategy .\\nIn the early 2010s , van der Zwaan was working in the London office of Skadden Arps , one of the world \\u2019 s largest and most powerful corporate law firms . His work seemed to focus on the former Soviet Union .\\nDuring this same time period , Manafort and Gates were working for Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych \\u2014 a Kremlin-backed leader with dubious democratic credentials .\\nYanukovych was in the midst of a power struggle with another prominent Ukrainian politician , which he decided to solve by jailing her in the fall of 2011 . Manafort and Gates \\u2019 s job was to run cover for this clearly undemocratic prosecution . So they retained a team from Skadden Arps , which included van der Zwaan , to put together a \\u201c report \\u201d that conveniently concluded that there was no political motive for putting her in jail .\\nThis was a big deal in Ukraine but a relatively obscure issue for most of the rest of the world . Manafort and Gates continued their work for Yanukovych afterward , and van der Zwaan moved on to other things \\u2014 most notably marrying Eva Khan , the daughter of Ukrainian-Russian billionaire German Khan , in the summer of 2017 . ( One of Khan \\u2019 s companies is , somewhat curiously , mentioned in the infamous Steele dossier . )\\nBut the Mueller investigation would soon deliver van der Zwaan an unhappy honeymoon . In the process of looking into Manafort and Gates \\u2019 s ties to the Kremlin , Mueller \\u2019 s team started investigating the Skadden Arps report . According to the indictment , FBI agents personally questioned van der Zwaan in November 2017 about his communications with Gates and an unidentified Person A .\\nVan der Zwaan told them that his last communication with Gates was in August 2016 and was an \\u201c innocuous text message , \\u201d and that he hadn \\u2019 t spoken to Person A since 2014 . This , according to the indictment , is a lie \\u2014 van der Zwaan was actually secretly communicating with Gates and Person A about the Skadden report .\\n\\u201c In or about September 2016 , he spoke with both Gates and Person A regarding the Report , and surreptitiously recorded the call , \\u201d the indictment says .\\nThe indictment also alleges that van der Zwaan deleted an email between himself and Person A sent around the same time as those conversations \\u2014 and told the FBI that he \\u201c did not know \\u201d where the email was .\\nVan der Zwaan is scheduled to appear in court on Tuesday at 2:30 pm EST to answer the indictment . He is expected to plead guilty , according to reports .\\nThe key piece of information in all of this is the timing : Manafort resigned as Trump \\u2019 s campaign manager on August 19 , 2016 \\u2014 weeks before the alleged conversations between Gates , Person A , and van der Zwaan . The resignation was the result of widespread reporting about Manafort \\u2019 s shady ties to Yanukovych , particularly an allegedly off-the-books payment .\\nIf Gates and van der Zwaan were talking about the Skadden report in September 2016 , and van der Zwaan felt the need to lie to the FBI about it , it suggests that there may have been something criminal about the report \\u2019 s production \\u2014 or at least , something whose release would be politically damaging .\\nGet van der Zwaan to get to Gates to get to Manafort\\nInterestingly , both CBS News and the Los Angeles Times reported on Monday that Gates had struck a plea deal with Mueller and would testify against Manafort , his former boss . It \\u2019 s not a stretch to think that evidence provided by van der Zwaan \\u2014 like his \\u201c surreptitious \\u201d recording of his call with Gates and Person A \\u2014 helped Mueller build a case strong enough that Gates had no choice but to flip .\\nGates , as Manafort \\u2019 s longtime assistant , might well have the goods on his former boss , who is one of the most pivotal players in the whole Trump-Russia scandal . It \\u2019 s conceivable that van der Zwaan might end up being the first domino in a chain of events that leads to a major breakthrough \\u2014 a Manafort conviction or plea deal .\\nRight now , that \\u2019 s speculation : We don \\u2019 t know how the Manafort case is actually going to play out . But that is almost certainly Mueller \\u2019 s strategy \\u2014 get van der Zwaan to get to Gates to get to Manafort , and from there , get vital information about Trump \\u2019 s real ties to Russia .\\nWhat this shows , more than anything else , is how methodical and wide-ranging the Mueller investigation is \\u2014 that it \\u2019 s willing to look all the way back to an obscure report from the winter of 2012 in order to get to the truth about the Trump-Russia scandal . Mueller is starting at the lowest level , with seemingly unrelated people like van der Zwaan , to get to the big fish .\",\n          \"( CNN ) Six days after Pop Smoke 's posthumous album dropped , Los Angeles police announced Thursday that five people , two of them juveniles , had been arrested in connection with the rapper 's February slaying .\\n`` LAPD Detectives have arrested three adult males and two juvenile males related to the Feb 19th murder , '' it said in a tweet . `` We will provide further details as they become available .

White House officials have been talking up such executive actions precisely because they expect so little from the Hill this year.\\n\\nThe one exception could be immigration, where the House GOP leadership will push a blueprint that gives those here illegally a path toward legal status but not citizenship, the New York Times reports. The president knows he can only muck up these tentative moves toward compromise, so he limited himself to a generic paragraph, urging both parties \\u201cto fix our broken immigration system\\u201d (and at least got a clap from John Boehner, \\u201cson of a barkeep,\\u201d sitting behind him.)\\n\\nThe president talked about pre-K and urged companies to hire the long-term unemployed.

And he touted the ObamaCare enrollment numbers and urged more people to sign up.\\n\\nAs for the broad theme of income inequality, Obama is playing to a divided nation.

The first is the arrival of Secretary of State John Kerry in Cuba. The second is President Obama\\u2019s continued campaign to secure Congressional approval for his flawed nuclear deal with Iran. These two dangerous developments represent the convergence of nearly every flawed strategic, moral, and economic notion that has driven President Obama\\u2019s foreign policy, and as such are emblematic of so many of the crises he has worsened around the world.\\n\\nTo fully understand what we\\u2019re dealing with in regards to Iran and Cuba, we have to understand who we\\u2019re dealing with. In Iran, we face radical Shia clerics who wish to one day unite the world under their version of Islam and who believe this will only happen after a cataclysmic showdown with the West. These leaders have been directly responsible for the deaths of hundreds of Americans and refuse to stop financing terrorists that seek to kill Americans and wipe Israel off the map.\\n\\nIn Cuba, we face proudly anti-American leaders who continue to work with nations like Russia and China to spy on our people and government; who harbor fugitives from American justice; and who stand in opposition to nearly every value our nation holds dear by violating the basic human rights of their own people, preventing democratic elections, and depriving their nation\\u2019s economy of freedom and opportunity.\\n\\nCenturies of global affairs tell us the best way to affect an outcome with volatile leaders is through strength and example, while the worst is through weakness and concession. Yet weakness and concession are the preferred tools of statecraft for this administration.\\n\\nPresident Obama has not only permitted Iran to retain its entire existing nuclear infrastructure, he has also endorsed the construction of a full-scale, industrial-size nuclear program within 15 years. He has conceded a vast enrichment capacity, preserved Iran\\u2019s fortified underground facility, and failed to secure \\u201canytime, anywhere\\u201d inspections. He has virtually guaranteed Iran becomes a regional power with the ability to build long-range missiles capable of hitting the U.S. homeland. And on top of all this, he wants to hand Iran $100 billion in sanctions relief, which will be used in part to fund Hamas and Hezbollah, promote instability in Bahrain and Yemen, and prop up Bashar al-Assad in Syria.\\n\\nThe negotiations with Cuba have proven equally one-sided. President Obama has rewarded the Castro regime for its repressive tactics and persistent, patient opposition to American interests. He has unilaterally given up on a half-century worth of policy toward the Castro regime that was agreed upon by presidents of both parties. He has ensured the regime will receive international legitimacy and a substantial economic boost to benefit its repression of the Cuban people, which has only increased since the President announced his new policy.\\n\\nBeginning on day one, I will undertake a three-part plan to roll back President Obama\\u2019s deal with Iran. First, I will quickly reimpose sanctions on Iran. I will give the mullahs a choice: either you have an economy or you have a nuclear program, but you cannot have both. I will also ask Congress to pass crushing new measures that target human rights abuses and the sponsorship of terrorism. Second, I will ensure our forces in the Middle East are positioned to signal readiness and restore a credible military option. Third, after imposing crippling sanctions on Iran, I will link any talks to Iran\\u2019s broader conduct, from human rights abuses to support for terrorism and threats against Israel.\\n\\nI will undertake an equally bold plan to roll back President Obama\\u2019s concessions to the Castro regime. First, on day one, I will give the Castros a choice: either continue repressing your people and lose the diplomatic relations provided by President Obama, or carry out meaningful political and human rights reforms and receive increased U.S. trade, investment, and support. Second, I will restore Cuba to the state sponsor of terror list until it stops supporting designated Foreign Terrorist Organizations, helping North Korea evade international sanctions, or harboring fugitives from American justice. Third, I will do everything in my power to provide support to Cuba\\u2019s pro-democracy movement and promote greater access to uncensored information for the Cuban people.\\n\\nThese are the actions required to restore the safety and security President Obama has cost us through his diplomacy with dictators. When it comes to the challenges posed by Iran and Cuba, our task is straightforward \\u2013 we must prevent Iran from gaining a nuclear weapon and we must guarantee that the United States stands on the Cuban people, not their oppressors. But we also know that 'straightforward' is not a synonym for 'easy.' Our safety and security will require what it has always required: strong, principled leadership. And that is exactly what I intend to offer our nation and the world in the years ahead.\\n\\n\",\n          \"ANALYSIS/OPINION:\\n\\nSome of our most dedicated feminists are trying to make a good thing of rape, heretofore regarded as one of the more horrific crimes. Once upon a time rape was even a capital crime, like murder. Many men went to the gallows or the electric chair for it.\\n\\nThe mere accusation of rape, like the accusation of molesting children, was usually horrific enough to guarantee conviction. Would a woman lie? Some men accused of rape died at the hands of a mob and many at the hands of the state and were often not actually guilty.\\n\\nRape was serious, dreadful business then. But now, sometimes, not so much.\\n\\nAnger, unfocused resentment and high dudgeon have lately inspired certain young women \\u2014 abetted by men and women in responsible positions who ought to know better (and probably do) \\u2014 to make uncorroborated claims of abuse that trivializes one of the meanest and most brutal crimes that a human can inflict on another.\\n\\nOne young woman, Lena Dunham, has made a television career of a sordid sex life and of being raped, or at least she thinks she was. She wrote a book about it.\\n\\nInnocent reputations suffer. Institutions are damaged when, like men, they pay for crimes that did not exist. Bearing false witness is a crime, too, and a serious one, legally no less than morally.\\n\\nRolling Stone magazine, the journal of rock music that sometimes aspires to big-boy journalism, is the current cause celebre, out with a sensational story of gang rape on the campus of the University of Virginia. Colleges and universities build their reputations slowly and sometimes inadvertently. The University of Alabama is celebrated as the nation\\u2019s foremost football factory. Georgetown is famous for having educated Bubba and infamous for the drunken students who have blighted the quiet residential streets surrounding its campus in Washington. And now Tom Jefferson\\u2019s university has become, fair or not, a place where cautious parents are wary of sending their daughters for a college education. Rolling Stone will now live in infamy as a rag that put a dent in the credibility of modern media everywhere.\\n\\nThe story in the magazine was a horrific one, more a tale from an Arabian night than from the cultured precincts of an American university town. A young women, identified by Rolling Stone only as \\u201cJackie,\\u201d said she went to a party in a fraternity house in Charlottesville and was set upon by a gang of ruffians, raped and scratched and beaten and left to make her escape without help. The details were set down in a story by one Sabrina Rubin Erdely in Rolling Stone.\\n\\n\\u201cJackie\\u201d provided neither corroborating evidence, and the magazine did not ask for a witness to go on the record with details. Her story was told in the usual purple ink, as evidence of the \\u201crape epidemic\\u201d said to be roiling campuses everywhere. \\u201cWho would lie about rape?\\u201d\\n\\nWhen her story began unravel, as others sought but could not find corroboration or evidence to support her story, Rolling Stone was left to explain the greater sin of the story. Feminists trotted out their usual shock that anyone could question a rape accusation; \\u201crape denial,\\u201d said one, \\u201cis like denying the Holocaust.\\u201d Maybe nothing happened, but it could have. Isn\\u2019t that enough?\\n\\nRolling Stone\\u2019s only defense was an apology, subject to revision, which in an earlier day would have been an unanswerable indictment of both its editors and its publishers. The apologies, such as they were, suggested that the university\\u2019s \\u201ctroubling history of indifference to many other instances of alleged sexual assaults\\u201d was to blame for its careless disregard for the fundamental canons of journalism. Newspapers and magazines have slipped into the newspaper graveyard for less.\\n\\n\\u201cBecause of the sensitive nature of Jackie\\u2019s story,\\u201d wrote Will Dana, the managing editor, \\u201cwe decided to honor her request not to contact the man she claimed participated in the attack, for fear of retaliation against her.\\u201d Facts have destroyed many a good story, and the magazine didn\\u2019t want that to happen to its account of Jackie\\u2019s lurid tale.\\n\\n\\u201cIn the face of new information,\\u201d the apology continued, \\u201cthere now appear to be discrepancies in Jackie\\u2019s account, and we have come to the conclusion that our trust in her was misplaced.\\u201d It wasn\\u2019t Rolling Stone\\u2019s fault, it was Jackie\\u2019s. \\u201cWe were trying to be sensitive to the unfair shame and humiliation many women feel after a sexual assault and now regret the decision to not contact the alleged assaulters to get their account.\\u201d It wasn\\u2019t Rolling Stone\\u2019s fault that it sold fiction as fact, it was society\\u2019s fault.

reviews.\\n\\nwith the sustained ovation for wounded veteran cory remsburg, obama briefly united congress and the television audience\\u2014even the snark on twitter was silenced\\u2014but the overall media reaction ranged from respectful to tepid.\\n\\nobama signaled during the media buildup to the speech that he wouldn\\u2019t be making sweeping proposals, and as state of the union rhetoric goes, \\u201cnew ladders of opportunity\\u201d isn\\u2019t exactly the new deal.\\n\\nbut the president faced two problems: a congress that won\\u2019t pass most of his agenda and an anemic economy: \\u201cthe cold, hard fact is that even in the midst of recovery, too many americans are working more than ever just to get by \\u2013 let alone get ahead. and too many still aren\\u2019t working at all.\\u201d\\n\\nit was a restrained speech\\u2014\\u201ca set of concrete, practical proposals\\u201d--matching obama\\u2019s reduced political circumstances after a rough political year.\\n\\n\\u201che can\\u2019t do many great things\\u201d without congress, said cbs\\u2019s bob schieffer.\\n\\n\\u201cquite predictable,\\u201d the hill\\u2019s a.b. stoddard said on fox. \\u201che didn\\u2019t break a lot of new ground.\\u201d\\n\\nnbc\\u2019s david gregory saw \\u201ca feisty president who wants to campaign for his party\\u201d on the minimum wage and other issues.\\n\\n\\u201ca rousing speech for people who like a lot of the agenda items,\\u201d said msnbc\\u2019s chris matthews.\\n\\nbut fox\\u2019s kirsten powers said that \\u201cthe speech was definitely oversold by the white house\\u201d and lacked a sense of \\u201curgency.\\u201d\\n\\nthere were numerous comparisons to bill clinton. \\u201che sounds like a president who realized he\\u2019s not going to get it down\\u2026and now he\\u2019s playing small ball,\\u201d said charles krauthammer.\\n\\nnewspapers also offered subdued assessments. \\u201cthis wasn\\u2019t the presidency barack obama had in mind after winning his historic election five years ago. but it is the one he believes he has left,\\u201d said the washington post.\\n\\nthe new york times was slightly more upbeat: \\u201cafter five years of fractious political combat, president obama declared independence from congress on tuesday as he vowed to tackle economic disparity with a series of limited initiatives on jobs, wages and retirement that he will take without legislative approval.\\u201d\\n\\nthese addresses are generally all talk, but obama gave his an extra kick by putting out word in the early morning that he would unilaterally raise the minimum wage for federal contractors to at least $10.10\\u2014this as he was about ask congress to boost the wage floor for all workers. white house officials have been talking up such executive actions precisely because they expect so little from the hill this year.\\n\\nthe one exception could be immigration, where the house gop leadership will push a blueprint that gives those here illegally a path toward legal status but not citizenship, the new york times reports. the president knows he can only muck up these tentative moves toward compromise, so he limited himself to a generic paragraph, urging both parties \\u201cto fix our broken immigration system\\u201d (and at least got a clap from john boehner, \\u201cson of a barkeep,\\u201d sitting behind him.)\\n\\nthe president talked about pre-k and urged companies to hire the long-term unemployed. he sprinkled his remarks with the names of ordinary people (the owner of punch pizza in minneapolis in his pitch for a higher minimum wage, a newly laid-off mother of two in his push for extending unemployment benefits). and he touted the obamacare enrollment numbers and urged more people to sign up.\\n\\nas for the broad theme of income inequality, obama is playing to a divided nation. in an nbc/wall street journal poll, 59 percent of obama voters say the government should do more on that front, while 52 percent of mitt romney voters say the government should do nothing.\\n\\nnow obama hits the road and tries to build a wave of coverage that lasts through the weekend. on the agenda: a friday interview with cnn's jake tapper.\\n\\nclick for more from media buzz\",\n          \"two historic events are in progress today, august 14. the first is the arrival of secretary of state john kerry in cuba. the second is president obama\\u2019s continued campaign to secure congressional approval for his flawed nuclear deal with iran. these two dangerous developments represent the convergence of nearly every flawed strategic, moral, and economic notion that has driven president obama\\u2019s foreign policy, and as such are emblematic of so many of the crises he has worsened around the world.\\n\\nto fully understand what we\\u2019re dealing with in regards to iran and cuba, we have to understand who we\\u2019re dealing with. in iran, we face radical shia clerics who wish to one day unite the world under their version of islam and who believe this will only happen after a cataclysmic showdown with the west. these leaders have been directly responsible for the deaths of hundreds of americans and refuse to stop financing terrorists that seek to kill americans and wipe israel off the map.\\n\\nin cuba, we face proudly anti-american leaders who continue to work with nations like russia and china to spy on our people and government; who harbor fugitives from american justice; and who stand in opposition to nearly every value our nation holds dear by violating the basic human rights of their own people, preventing democratic elections, and depriving their nation\\u2019s economy of freedom and opportunity.\\n\\ncenturies of global affairs tell us the best way to affect an outcome with volatile leaders is through strength and example, while the worst is through weakness and concession. yet weakness and concession are the preferred tools of statecraft for this administration.\\n\\npresident obama has not only permitted iran to retain its entire existing nuclear infrastructure, he has also endorsed the construction of a full-scale, industrial-size nuclear program within 15 years. he has conceded a vast enrichment capacity, preserved iran\\u2019s fortified underground facility, and failed to secure \\u201canytime, anywhere\\u201d inspections. he has virtually guaranteed iran becomes a regional power with the ability to build long-range missiles capable of hitting the u.s. homeland. and on top of all this, he wants to hand iran $100 billion in sanctions relief, which will be used in part to fund hamas and hezbollah, promote instability in bahrain and yemen, and prop up bashar al-assad in syria.\\n\\nthe negotiations with cuba have proven equally one-sided. president obama has rewarded the castro regime for its repressive tactics and persistent, patient opposition to american interests. he has unilaterally given up on a half-century worth of policy toward the castro regime that was agreed upon by presidents of both parties. he has ensured the regime will receive international legitimacy and a substantial economic boost to benefit its repression of the cuban people, which has only increased since the president announced his new policy.\\n\\nbeginning on day one, i will undertake a three-part plan to roll back president obama\\u2019s deal with iran. first, i will quickly reimpose sanctions on iran. i will give the mullahs a choice: either you have an economy or you have a nuclear program, but you cannot have both. i will also ask congress to pass crushing new measures that target human rights abuses and the sponsorship of terrorism. second, i will ensure our forces in the middle east are positioned to signal readiness and restore a credible military option. third, after imposing crippling sanctions on iran, i will link any talks to iran\\u2019s broader conduct, from human rights abuses to support for terrorism and threats against israel.\\n\\ni will undertake an equally bold plan to roll back president obama\\u2019s concessions to the castro regime. first, on day one, i will give the castros a choice: either continue repressing your people and lose the diplomatic relations provided by president obama, or carry out meaningful political and human rights reforms and receive increased u.s. trade, investment, and support. second, i will restore cuba to the state sponsor of terror list until it stops supporting designated foreign terrorist organizations, helping north korea evade international sanctions, or harboring fugitives from american justice. third, i will do everything in my power to provide support to cuba\\u2019s pro-democracy movement and promote greater access to uncensored information for the cuban people.\\n\\nthese are the actions required to restore the safety and security president obama has cost us through his diplomacy with dictators. when it comes to the challenges posed by iran and cuba, our task is straightforward \\u2013 we must prevent iran from gaining a nuclear weapon and we must guarantee that the united states stands on the cuban people, not their oppressors. but we also know that 'straightforward' is not a synonym for 'easy.' our safety and security will require what it has always required: strong, principled leadership. and that is exactly what i intend to offer our nation and the world in the years ahead.\\n\\n\",\n          \"analysis/opinion:\\n\\nsome of our most dedicated feminists are trying to make a good thing of rape, heretofore regarded as one of the more horrific crimes. once upon a time rape was even a capital crime, like murder. many men went to the gallows or the electric chair for it.\\n\\nthe mere accusation of rape, like the accusation of molesting children, was usually horrific enough to guarantee conviction. would a woman lie? some men accused of rape died at the hands of a mob and many at the hands of the state and were often not actually guilty.\\n\\nrape was serious, dreadful business then. but now, sometimes, not so much.\\n\\nanger, unfocused resentment and high dudgeon have lately inspired certain young women \\u2014 abetted by men and women in responsible positions who ought to know better (and probably do) \\u2014 to make uncorroborated claims of abuse that trivializes one of the meanest and most brutal crimes that a human can inflict on another.\\n\\none young woman, lena dunham, has made a television career of a sordid sex life and of being raped, or at least she thinks she was. she wrote a book about it.\\n\\ninnocent reputations suffer. institutions are damaged when, like men, they pay for crimes that did not exist. bearing false witness is a crime, too, and a serious one, legally no less than morally.\\n\\nrolling stone magazine, the journal of rock music that sometimes aspires to big-boy journalism, is the current cause celebre, out with a sensational story of gang rape on the campus of the university of virginia. colleges and universities build their reputations slowly and sometimes inadvertently. the university of alabama is celebrated as the nation\\u2019s foremost football factory. georgetown is famous for having educated bubba and infamous for the drunken students who have blighted the quiet residential streets surrounding its campus in washington. and now tom jefferson\\u2019s university has become, fair or not, a place where cautious parents are wary of sending their daughters for a college education. rolling stone will now live in infamy as a rag that put a dent in the credibility of modern media everywhere.\\n\\nthe story in the magazine was a horrific one, more a tale from an arabian night than from the cultured precincts of an american university town. a young women, identified by rolling stone only as \\u201cjackie,\\u201d said she went to a party in a fraternity house in charlottesville and was set upon by a gang of ruffians, raped and scratched and beaten and left to make her escape without help. the details were set down in a story by one sabrina rubin erdely in rolling stone.\\n\\n\\u201cjackie\\u201d provided neither corroborating evidence, and the magazine did not ask for a witness to go on the record with details. her story was told in the usual purple ink, as evidence of the \\u201crape epidemic\\u201d said to be roiling campuses everywhere. \\u201cwho would lie about rape?\\u201d\\n\\nwhen her story began unravel, as others sought but could not find corroboration or evidence to support her story, rolling stone was left to explain the greater sin of the story. feminists trotted out their usual shock that anyone could question a rape accusation; \\u201crape denial,\\u201d said one, \\u201cis like denying the holocaust.\\u201d maybe nothing happened, but it could have. isn\\u2019t that enough?\\n\\nrolling stone\\u2019s only defense was an apology, subject to revision, which in an earlier day would have been an unanswerable indictment of both its editors and its publishers. the apologies, such as they were, suggested that the university\\u2019s \\u201ctroubling history of indifference to many other instances of alleged sexual assaults\\u201d was to blame for its careless disregard for the fundamental canons of journalism. newspapers and magazines have slipped into the newspaper graveyard for less.\\n\\n\\u201cbecause of the sensitive nature of jackie\\u2019s story,\\u201d wrote will dana, the managing editor, \\u201cwe decided to honor her request not to contact the man she claimed participated in the attack, for fear of retaliation against her.\\u201d facts have destroyed many a good story, and the magazine didn\\u2019t want that to happen to its account of jackie\\u2019s lurid tale.\\n\\n\\u201cin the face of new information,\\u201d the apology continued, \\u201cthere now appear to be discrepancies in jackie\\u2019s account, and we have come to the conclusion that our trust in her was misplaced.\\u201d it wasn\\u2019t rolling stone\\u2019s fault, it was jackie\\u2019s. \\u201cwe were trying to be sensitive to the unfair shame and humiliation many women feel after a sexual assault and now regret the decision to not contact the alleged assaulters to get their account.\\u201d it wasn\\u2019t rolling stone\\u2019s fault that it sold fiction as fact, it was society\\u2019s fault. lawyers are now on the scout for an identifiable plaintiff against the stone.\\n\\n\\u2022 wesley

reviews\\n\\nwith the sustained ovation for wounded veteran cory remsburg obama briefly united congress and the television audienceeven the snark on twitter was silencedbut the overall media reaction ranged from respectful to tepid\\n\\nobama signaled during the media buildup to the speech that he wouldnt be making sweeping proposals and as state of the union rhetoric goes new ladders of opportunity isnt exactly the new deal\\n\\nbut the president faced two problems a congress that wont pass most of his agenda and an anemic economy the cold hard fact is that even in the midst of recovery too many americans are working more than ever just to get by  let alone get ahead and too many still arent working at all\\n\\nit was a restrained speecha set of concrete practical proposalsmatching obamas reduced political circumstances after a rough political year\\n\\nhe cant do many great things without congress said cbss bob schieffer\\n\\nquite predictable the hills ab stoddard said on fox he didnt break a lot of new ground\\n\\nnbcs david gregory saw a feisty president who wants to campaign for his party on the minimum wage and other issues\\n\\na rousing speech for people who like a lot of the agenda items said msnbcs chris matthews\\n\\nbut foxs kirsten powers said that the speech was definitely oversold by the white house and lacked a sense of urgency\\n\\nthere were numerous comparisons to bill clinton he sounds like a president who realized hes not going to get it downand now hes playing small ball said charles krauthammer\\n\\nnewspapers also offered subdued assessments this wasnt the presidency barack obama had in mind after winning his historic election five years ago but it is the one he believes he has left said the washington post\\n\\nthe new york times was slightly more upbeat after five years of fractious political combat president obama declared independence from congress on tuesday as he vowed to tackle economic disparity with a series of limited initiatives on jobs wages and retirement that he will take without legislative approval\\n\\nthese addresses are generally all talk but obama gave his an extra kick by putting out word in the early morning that he would unilaterally raise the minimum wage for federal contractors to at least 1010this as he was about ask congress to boost the wage floor for all workers white house officials have been talking up such executive actions precisely because they expect so little from the hill this year\\n\\nthe one exception could be immigration where the house gop leadership will push a blueprint that gives those here illegally a path toward legal status but not citizenship the new york times reports the president knows he can only muck up these tentative moves toward compromise so he limited himself to a generic paragraph urging both parties to fix our broken immigration system and at least got a clap from john boehner son of a barkeep sitting behind him\\n\\nthe president talked about prek and urged companies to hire the longterm unemployed he sprinkled his remarks with the names of ordinary people the owner of punch pizza in minneapolis in his pitch for a higher minimum wage a newly laidoff mother of two in his push for extending unemployment benefits and he touted the obamacare enrollment numbers and urged more people to sign up\\n\\nas for the broad theme of income inequality obama is playing to a divided nation in an nbcwall street journal poll 59 percent of obama voters say the government should do more on that front while 52 percent of mitt romney voters say the government should do nothing\\n\\nnow obama hits the road and tries to build a wave of coverage that lasts through the weekend on the agenda a friday interview with cnns jake tapper\\n\\nclick for more from media buzz\",\n          \"two historic events are in progress today august 14 the first is the arrival of secretary of state john kerry in cuba the second is president obamas continued campaign to secure congressional approval for his flawed nuclear deal with iran these two dangerous developments represent the convergence of nearly every flawed strategic moral and economic notion that has driven president obamas foreign policy and as such are emblematic of so many of the crises he has worsened around the world\\n\\nto fully understand what were dealing with in regards to iran and cuba we have to understand who were dealing with in iran we face radical shia clerics who wish to one day unite the world under their version of islam and who believe this will only happen after a cataclysmic showdown with the west these leaders have been directly responsible for the deaths of hundreds of americans and refuse to stop financing terrorists that seek to kill americans and wipe israel off the map\\n\\nin cuba we face proudly antiamerican leaders who continue to work with nations like russia and china to spy on our people and government who harbor fugitives from american justice and who stand in opposition to nearly every value our nation holds dear by violating the basic human rights of their own people preventing democratic elections and depriving their nations economy of freedom and opportunity\\n\\ncenturies of global affairs tell us the best way to affect an outcome with volatile leaders is through strength and example while the worst is through weakness and concession yet weakness and concession are the preferred tools of statecraft for this administration\\n\\npresident obama has not only permitted iran to retain its entire existing nuclear infrastructure he has also endorsed the construction of a fullscale industrialsize nuclear program within 15 years he has conceded a vast enrichment capacity preserved irans fortified underground facility and failed to secure anytime anywhere inspections he has virtually guaranteed iran becomes a regional power with the ability to build longrange missiles capable of hitting the us homeland and on top of all this he wants to hand iran 100 billion in sanctions relief which will be used in part to fund hamas and hezbollah promote instability in bahrain and yemen and prop up bashar alassad in syria\\n\\nthe negotiations with cuba have proven equally onesided president obama has rewarded the castro regime for its repressive tactics and persistent patient opposition to american interests he has unilaterally given up on a halfcentury worth of policy toward the castro regime that was agreed upon by presidents of both parties he has ensured the regime will receive international legitimacy and a substantial economic boost to benefit its repression of the cuban people which has only increased since the president announced his new policy\\n\\nbeginning on day one i will undertake a threepart plan to roll back president obamas deal with iran first i will quickly reimpose sanctions on iran i will give the mullahs a choice either you have an economy or you have a nuclear program but you cannot have both i will also ask congress to pass crushing new measures that target human rights abuses and the sponsorship of terrorism second i will ensure our forces in the middle east are positioned to signal readiness and restore a credible military option third after imposing crippling sanctions on iran i will link any talks to irans broader conduct from human rights abuses to support for terrorism and threats against israel\\n\\ni will undertake an equally bold plan to roll back president obamas concessions to the castro regime first on day one i will give the castros a choice either continue repressing your people and lose the diplomatic relations provided by president obama or carry out meaningful political and human rights reforms and receive increased us trade investment and support second i will restore cuba to the state sponsor of terror list until it stops supporting designated foreign terrorist organizations helping north korea evade international sanctions or harboring fugitives from american justice third i will do everything in my power to provide support to cubas prodemocracy movement and promote greater access to uncensored information for the cuban people\\n\\nthese are the actions required to restore the safety and security president obama has cost us through his diplomacy with dictators when it comes to the challenges posed by iran and cuba our task is straightforward  we must prevent iran from gaining a nuclear weapon and we must guarantee that the united states stands on the cuban people not their oppressors but we also know that straightforward is not a synonym for easy our safety and security will require what it has always required strong principled leadership and that is exactly what i intend to offer our nation and the world in the years ahead\\n\\n\",\n          \"analysisopinion\\n\\nsome of our most dedicated feminists are trying to make a good thing of rape heretofore regarded as one of the more horrific crimes once upon a time rape was even a capital crime like murder many men went to the gallows or the electric chair for it\\n\\nthe mere accusation of rape like the accusation of molesting children was usually horrific enough to guarantee conviction would a woman lie some men accused of rape died at the hands of a mob and many at the hands of the state and were often not actually guilty\\n\\nrape was serious dreadful business then but now sometimes not so much\\n\\nanger unfocused resentment and high dudgeon have lately inspired certain young women  abetted by men and women in responsible positions who ought to know better and probably do  to make uncorroborated claims of abuse that trivializes one of the meanest and most brutal crimes that a human can inflict on another\\n\\none young woman lena dunham has made a television career of a sordid sex life and of being raped or at least she thinks she was she wrote a book about it\\n\\ninnocent reputations suffer institutions are damaged when like men they pay for crimes that did not exist bearing false witness is a crime too and a serious one legally no less than morally\\n\\nrolling stone magazine the journal of rock music that sometimes aspires to bigboy journalism is the current cause celebre out with a sensational story of gang rape on the campus of the university of virginia colleges and universities build their reputations slowly and sometimes inadvertently the university of alabama is celebrated as the nations foremost football factory georgetown is famous for having educated bubba and infamous for the drunken students who have blighted the quiet residential streets surrounding its campus in washington and now tom jeffersons university has become fair or not a place where cautious parents are wary of sending their daughters for a college education rolling stone will now live in infamy as a rag that put a dent in the credibility of modern media everywhere\\n\\nthe story in the magazine was a horrific one more a tale from an arabian night than from the cultured precincts of an american university town a young women identified by rolling stone only as jackie said she went to a party in a fraternity house in charlottesville and was set upon by a gang of ruffians raped and scratched and beaten and left to make her escape without help the details were set down in a story by one sabrina rubin erdely in rolling stone\\n\\njackie provided neither corroborating evidence and the magazine did not ask for a witness to go on the record with details her story was told in the usual purple ink as evidence of the rape epidemic said to be roiling campuses everywhere who would lie about rape\\n\\nwhen her story began unravel as others sought but could not find corroboration or evidence to support her story rolling stone was left to explain the greater sin of the story feminists trotted out their usual shock that anyone could question a rape accusation rape denial said one is like denying the holocaust maybe nothing happened but it could have isnt that enough\\n\\nrolling stones only defense was an apology subject to revision which in an earlier day would have been an unanswerable indictment of both its editors and its publishers the apologies such as they were suggested that the universitys troubling history of indifference to many other instances of alleged sexual assaults was to blame for its careless disregard for the fundamental canons of journalism newspapers and magazines have slipped into the newspaper graveyard for less\\n\\nbecause of the sensitive nature of jackies story wrote will dana the managing editor we decided to honor her request not to contact the man she claimed participated in the attack for fear of retaliation against her facts have destroyed many a good story and the magazine didnt want that to happen to its account of jackies lurid tale\\n\\nin the face of new information the apology continued there now appear to be discrepancies in jackies account and we have come to the conclusion that our trust in her was misplaced it wasnt rolling stones fault it was jackies we were trying to be sensitive to the unfair shame and humiliation many women feel after a sexual assault and now regret the decision to not contact the alleged assaulters to get their account it wasnt rolling stones fault that it sold fiction as fact it was societys fault lawyers are now on the scout for an identifiable plaintiff against the stone\\n\\n wesley pruden is editor emeritus of

reviews\\n\\nwith the sustained ovation for wounded veteran cory remsburg obama briefly united congress and the television audienceeven the snark on twitter was silencedbut the overall media reaction ranged from respectful to tepid\\n\\nobama signaled during the media buildup to the speech that he wouldnt be making sweeping proposals and as state of the union rhetoric goes new ladders of opportunity isnt exactly the new deal\\n\\nbut the president faced two problems a congress that wont pass most of his agenda and an anemic economy the cold hard fact is that even in the midst of recovery too many americans are working more than ever just to get by  let alone get ahead and too many still arent working at all\\n\\nit was a restrained speecha set of concrete practical proposalsmatching obamas reduced political circumstances after a rough political year\\n\\nhe cant do many great things without congress said cbss bob schieffer\\n\\nquite predictable the hills ab stoddard said on fox he didnt break a lot of new ground\\n\\nnbcs david gregory saw a feisty president who wants to campaign for his party on the minimum wage and other issues\\n\\na rousing speech for people who like a lot of the agenda items said msnbcs chris matthews\\n\\nbut foxs kirsten powers said that the speech was definitely oversold by the white house and lacked a sense of urgency\\n\\nthere were numerous comparisons to bill clinton he sounds like a president who realized hes not going to get it downand now hes playing small ball said charles krauthammer\\n\\nnewspapers also offered subdued assessments this wasnt the presidency barack obama had in mind after winning his historic election five years ago but it is the one he believes he has left said the washington post\\n\\nthe new york times was slightly more upbeat after five years of fractious political combat president obama declared independence from congress on tuesday as he vowed to tackle economic disparity with a series of limited initiatives on jobs wages and retirement that he will take without legislative approval\\n\\nthese addresses are generally all talk but obama gave his an extra kick by putting out word in the early morning that he would unilaterally raise the minimum wage for federal contractors to at least 1010this as he was about ask congress to boost the wage floor for all workers white house officials have been talking up such executive actions precisely because they expect so little from the hill this year\\n\\nthe one exception could be immigration where the house gop leadership will push a blueprint that gives those here illegally a path toward legal status but not citizenship the new york times reports the president knows he can only muck up these tentative moves toward compromise so he limited himself to a generic paragraph urging both parties to fix our broken immigration system and at least got a clap from john boehner son of a barkeep sitting behind him\\n\\nthe president talked about prek and urged companies to hire the longterm unemployed he sprinkled his remarks with the names of ordinary people the owner of punch pizza in minneapolis in his pitch for a higher minimum wage a newly laidoff mother of two in his push for extending unemployment benefits and he touted the obamacare enrollment numbers and urged more people to sign up\\n\\nas for the broad theme of income inequality obama is playing to a divided nation in an nbcwall street journal poll 59 percent of obama voters say the government should do more on that front while 52 percent of mitt romney voters say the government should do nothing\\n\\nnow obama hits the road and tries to build a wave of coverage that lasts through the weekend on the agenda a friday interview with cnns jake tapper\\n\\nclick for more from media buzz\",\n          \"two historic events are in progress today august 14 the first is the arrival of secretary of state john kerry in cuba the second is president obamas continued campaign to secure congressional approval for his flawed nuclear deal with iran these two dangerous developments represent the convergence of nearly every flawed strategic moral and economic notion that has driven president obamas foreign policy and as such are emblematic of so many of the crises he has worsened around the world\\n\\nto fully understand what were dealing with in regards to iran and cuba we have to understand who were dealing with in iran we face radical shia clerics who wish to one day unite the world under their version of islam and who believe this will only happen after a cataclysmic showdown with the west these leaders have been directly responsible for the deaths of hundreds of americans and refuse to stop financing terrorists that seek to kill americans and wipe israel off the map\\n\\nin cuba we face proudly antiamerican leaders who continue to work with nations like russia and china to spy on our people and government who harbor fugitives from american justice and who stand in opposition to nearly every value our nation holds dear by violating the basic human rights of their own people preventing democratic elections and depriving their nations economy of freedom and opportunity\\n\\ncenturies of global affairs tell us the best way to affect an outcome with volatile leaders is through strength and example while the worst is through weakness and concession yet weakness and concession are the preferred tools of statecraft for this administration\\n\\npresident obama has not only permitted iran to retain its entire existing nuclear infrastructure he has also endorsed the construction of a fullscale industrialsize nuclear program within 15 years he has conceded a vast enrichment capacity preserved irans fortified underground facility and failed to secure anytime anywhere inspections he has virtually guaranteed iran becomes a regional power with the ability to build longrange missiles capable of hitting the us homeland and on top of all this he wants to hand iran 100 billion in sanctions relief which will be used in part to fund hamas and hezbollah promote instability in bahrain and yemen and prop up bashar alassad in syria\\n\\nthe negotiations with cuba have proven equally onesided president obama has rewarded the castro regime for its repressive tactics and persistent patient opposition to american interests he has unilaterally given up on a halfcentury worth of policy toward the castro regime that was agreed upon by presidents of both parties he has ensured the regime will receive international legitimacy and a substantial economic boost to benefit its repression of the cuban people which has only increased since the president announced his new policy\\n\\nbeginning on day one i will undertake a threepart plan to roll back president obamas deal with iran first i will quickly reimpose sanctions on iran i will give the mullahs a choice either you have an economy or you have a nuclear program but you cannot have both i will also ask congress to pass crushing new measures that target human rights abuses and the sponsorship of terrorism second i will ensure our forces in the middle east are positioned to signal readiness and restore a credible military option third after imposing crippling sanctions on iran i will link any talks to irans broader conduct from human rights abuses to support for terrorism and threats against israel\\n\\ni will undertake an equally bold plan to roll back president obamas concessions to the castro regime first on day one i will give the castros a choice either continue repressing your people and lose the diplomatic relations provided by president obama or carry out meaningful political and human rights reforms and receive increased us trade investment and support second i will restore cuba to the state sponsor of terror list until it stops supporting designated foreign terrorist organizations helping north korea evade international sanctions or harboring fugitives from american justice third i will do everything in my power to provide support to cubas prodemocracy movement and promote greater access to uncensored information for the cuban people\\n\\nthese are the actions required to restore the safety and security president obama has cost us through his diplomacy with dictators when it comes to the challenges posed by iran and cuba our task is straightforward  we must prevent iran from gaining a nuclear weapon and we must guarantee that the united states stands on the cuban people not their oppressors but we also know that straightforward is not a synonym for easy our safety and security will require what it has always required strong principled leadership and that is exactly what i intend to offer our nation and the world in the years ahead\\n\\n\",\n          \"analysisopinion\\n\\nsome of our most dedicated feminists are trying to make a good thing of rape heretofore regarded as one of the more horrific crimes once upon a time rape was even a capital crime like murder many men went to the gallows or the electric chair for it\\n\\nthe mere accusation of rape like the accusation of molesting children was usually horrific enough to guarantee conviction would a woman lie some men accused of rape died at the hands of a mob and many at the hands of the state and were often not actually guilty\\n\\nrape was serious dreadful business then but now sometimes not so much\\n\\nanger unfocused resentment and high dudgeon have lately inspired certain young women  abetted by men and women in responsible positions who ought to know better and probably do  to make uncorroborated claims of abuse that trivializes one of the meanest and most brutal crimes that a human can inflict on another\\n\\none young woman lena dunham has made a television career of a sordid sex life and of being raped or at least she thinks she was she wrote a book about it\\n\\ninnocent reputations suffer institutions are damaged when like men they pay for crimes that did not exist bearing false witness is a crime too and a serious one legally no less than morally\\n\\nrolling stone magazine the journal of rock music that sometimes aspires to bigboy journalism is the current cause celebre out with a sensational story of gang rape on the campus of the university of virginia colleges and universities build their reputations slowly and sometimes inadvertently the university of alabama is celebrated as the nations foremost football factory georgetown is famous for having educated bubba and infamous for the drunken students who have blighted the quiet residential streets surrounding its campus in washington and now tom jeffersons university has become fair or not a place where cautious parents are wary of sending their daughters for a college education rolling stone will now live in infamy as a rag that put a dent in the credibility of modern media everywhere\\n\\nthe story in the magazine was a horrific one more a tale from an arabian night than from the cultured precincts of an american university town a young women identified by rolling stone only as jackie said she went to a party in a fraternity house in charlottesville and was set upon by a gang of ruffians raped and scratched and beaten and left to make her escape without help the details were set down in a story by one sabrina rubin erdely in rolling stone\\n\\njackie provided neither corroborating evidence and the magazine did not ask for a witness to go on the record with details her story was told in the usual purple ink as evidence of the rape epidemic said to be roiling campuses everywhere who would lie about rape\\n\\nwhen her story began unravel as others sought but could not find corroboration or evidence to support her story rolling stone was left to explain the greater sin of the story feminists trotted out their usual shock that anyone could question a rape accusation rape denial said one is like denying the holocaust maybe nothing happened but it could have isnt that enough\\n\\nrolling stones only defense was an apology subject to revision which in an earlier day would have been an unanswerable indictment of both its editors and its publishers the apologies such as they were suggested that the universitys troubling history of indifference to many other instances of alleged sexual assaults was to blame for its careless disregard for the fundamental canons of journalism newspapers and magazines have slipped into the newspaper graveyard for less\\n\\nbecause of the sensitive nature of jackies story wrote will dana the managing editor we decided to honor her request not to contact the man she claimed participated in the attack for fear of retaliation against her facts have destroyed many a good story and the magazine didnt want that to happen to its account of jackies lurid tale\\n\\nin the face of new information the apology continued there now appear to be discrepancies in jackies account and we have come to the conclusion that our trust in her was misplaced it wasnt rolling stones fault it was jackies we were trying to be sensitive to the unfair shame and humiliation many women feel after a sexual assault and now regret the decision to not contact the alleged assaulters to get their account it wasnt rolling stones fault that it sold fiction as fact it was societys fault lawyers are now on the scout for an identifiable plaintiff against the stone\\n\\n wesley pruden is editor emeritus of

ranged from respectful to tepid\\n\\nobama signaled during the media buildup to the speech that he wouldnt be making sweeping proposals and as state of the union rhetoric goes new ladders of opportunity isnt exactly the new deal\\n\\nbut the president faced two problems a congress that wont pass most of his agenda and an anemic economy the cold hard fact is that even in the midst of recovery too many americans are working more than ever just to get by  let alone get ahead and too many still arent working at all\\n\\nit was a restrained speecha set of concrete practical proposalsmatching obamas reduced political circumstances after a rough political year\\n\\nhe cant do many great things without congress said cbss bob schieffer\\n\\nquite predictable the hills ab stoddard said on fox he didnt break a lot of new ground\\n\\nnbcs david gregory saw a feisty president who wants to campaign for his party on the minimum wage and other issues\\n\\na rousing speech for people who like a lot of the agenda items said msnbcs chris matthews\\n\\nbut foxs kirsten powers said that the speech was definitely oversold by the white house and lacked a sense of urgency\\n\\nthere were numerous comparisons to bill clinton he sounds like a president who realized hes not going to get it downand now hes playing small ball said charles krauthammer\\n\\nnewspapers also offered subdued assessments this wasnt the presidency barack obama had in mind after winning his historic election five years ago but it is the one he believes he has left said the washington post\\n\\nthe new york times was slightly more upbeat after five years of fractious political combat president obama declared independence from congress on tuesday as he vowed to tackle economic disparity with a series of limited initiatives on jobs wages and retirement that he will take without legislative approval\\n\\nthese addresses are generally all talk but obama gave his an extra kick by putting out word in the early morning that he would unilaterally raise the minimum wage for federal contractors to at least 1010this as he was about ask congress to boost the wage floor for all workers white house officials have been talking up such executive actions precisely because they expect so little from the hill this year\\n\\nthe one exception could be immigration where the house gop leadership will push a blueprint that gives those here illegally a path toward legal status but not citizenship the new york times reports the president knows he can only muck up these tentative moves toward compromise so he limited himself to a generic paragraph urging both parties to fix our broken immigration system and at least got a clap from john boehner son of a barkeep sitting behind him\\n\\nthe president talked about prek and urged companies to hire the longterm unemployed he sprinkled his remarks with the names of ordinary people the owner of punch pizza in minneapolis in his pitch for a higher minimum wage a newly laidoff mother of two in his push for extending unemployment benefits and he touted the obamacare enrollment numbers and urged more people to sign up\\n\\nas for the broad theme of income inequality obama is playing to a divided nation in an nbcwall street journal poll 59 percent of obama voters say the government should do more on that front while 52 percent of mitt romney voters say the government should do nothing\\n\\nnow obama hits the road and tries to build a wave of coverage that lasts through the weekend on the agenda a friday interview with cnns jake tapper\\n\\nclick for more from media buzz\",\n          \"two historic events are in progress today august 14 the first is the arrival of secretary of state john kerry in cuba the second is president obamas continued campaign to secure congressional approval for his flawed nuclear deal with iran these two dangerous developments represent the convergence of nearly every flawed strategic moral and economic notion that has driven president obamas foreign policy and as such are emblematic of so many of the crises he has worsened around the world\\n\\nto fully understand what were dealing with in regards to iran and cuba we have to understand who were dealing with in iran we face radical shia clerics who wish to one day unite the world under their version of islam and who believe this will only happen after a cataclysmic showdown with the west these leaders have been directly responsible for the deaths of hundreds of americans and refuse to stop financing terrorists that seek to kill americans and wipe israel off the map\\n\\nin cuba we face proudly antiamerican leaders who continue to work with nations like russia and china to spy on our people and government who harbor fugitives from american justice and who stand in opposition to nearly every value our nation holds dear by violating the basic human rights of their own people preventing democratic elections and depriving their nations economy of freedom and opportunity\\n\\ncenturies of global affairs tell us the best way to affect an outcome with volatile leaders is through strength and example while the worst is through weakness and concession yet weakness and concession are the preferred tools of statecraft for this administration\\n\\npresident obama has not only permitted iran to retain its entire existing nuclear infrastructure he has also endorsed the construction of a fullscale industrialsize nuclear program within 15 years he has conceded a vast enrichment capacity preserved irans fortified underground facility and failed to secure anytime anywhere inspections he has virtually guaranteed iran becomes a regional power with the ability to build longrange missiles capable of hitting the us homeland and on top of all this he wants to hand iran 100 billion in sanctions relief which will be used in part to fund hamas and hezbollah promote instability in bahrain and yemen and prop up bashar alassad in syria\\n\\nthe negotiations with cuba have proven equally onesided president obama has rewarded the castro regime for its repressive tactics and persistent patient opposition to american interests he has unilaterally given up on a halfcentury worth of policy toward the castro regime that was agreed upon by presidents of both parties he has ensured the regime will receive international legitimacy and a substantial economic boost to benefit its repression of the cuban people which has only increased since the president announced his new policy\\n\\nbeginning on day one i will undertake a threepart plan to roll back president obamas deal with iran first i will quickly reimpose sanctions on iran i will give the mullahs a choice either you have an economy or you have a nuclear program but you cannot have both i will also ask congress to pass crushing new measures that target human rights abuses and the sponsorship of terrorism second i will ensure our forces in the middle east are positioned to signal readiness and restore a credible military option third after imposing crippling sanctions on iran i will link any talks to irans broader conduct from human rights abuses to support for terrorism and threats against israel\\n\\ni will undertake an equally bold plan to roll back president obamas concessions to the castro regime first on day one i will give the castros a choice either continue repressing your people and lose the diplomatic relations provided by president obama or carry out meaningful political and human rights reforms and receive increased us trade investment and support second i will restore cuba to the state sponsor of terror list until it stops supporting designated foreign terrorist organizations helping north korea evade international sanctions or harboring fugitives from american justice third i will do everything in my power to provide support to cubas prodemocracy movement and promote greater access to uncensored information for the cuban people\\n\\nthese are the actions required to restore the safety and security president obama has cost us through his diplomacy with dictators when it comes to the challenges posed by iran and cuba our task is straightforward  we must prevent iran from gaining a nuclear weapon and we must guarantee that the united states stands on the cuban people not their oppressors but we also know that straightforward is not a synonym for easy our safety and security will require what it has always required strong principled leadership and that is exactly what i intend to offer our nation and the world in the years ahead\\n\\n\",\n          \"analysisopinion\\n\\nsome of our most dedicated feminists are trying to make a good thing of rape heretofore regarded as one of the more horrific crimes once upon a time rape was even a capital crime like murder many men went to the gallows or the electric chair for it\\n\\nthe mere

hands of the state and were often not actually guilty\\n\\nrape was serious dreadful business then but now sometimes not so much\\n\\nanger unfocused resentment and high dudgeon have lately inspired certain young women  abetted by men and women in responsible positions who ought to know better and probably do  to make uncorroborated claims of abuse that trivializes one of the meanest and most brutal crimes that a human can inflict on another\\n\\none young woman lena dunham has made a television career of a sordid sex life and of being raped or at least she thinks she was she wrote a book about it\\n\\ninnocent reputations suffer institutions are damaged when like men they pay for crimes that did not exist bearing false witness is a crime too and a serious one legally no less than

university of virginia colleges and universities build their reputations slowly and sometimes inadvertently the university of alabama is celebrated as the nations foremost football factory georgetown is famous for having educated bubba and infamous for the drunken students who have blighted the quiet residential streets surrounding its campus in washington and now tom jeffersons university has become fair or not a place where cautious parents are wary of sending their daughters for a college education rolling stone will now live in infamy as a rag that put a dent in the credibility of modern media everywhere\\n\\nthe story in the magazine was a horrific one more a tale from an arabian night than from the cultured precincts of an american university town a young women identified by rolling stone only as jackie said she went to a party in a fraternity house in charlottesville and was set upon by a gang of ruffians raped and scratched and beaten and left to make her escape without help the details were set down in a story by one sabrina rubin erdely in rolling stone\\n\\njackie provided neither corroborating evidence and the magazine did not ask for a witness to go on the record with details her story was told in the usual purple ink as evidence of the rape epidemic said to be roiling campuses everywhere who would lie about rape\\n\\nwhen her story began unravel as others sought but could not find corroboration or evidence to support her story rolling stone was left to explain the greater sin of the story feminists trotted out their usual shock that anyone could question a rape accusation rape denial said one is like denying the holocaust maybe nothing happened but it could have isnt that enough\\n\\nrolling stones only defense was an apology subject to revision which in an earlier day would have been an unanswerable indictment of both its editors and its publishers the apologies such as they were suggested that the universitys troubling history of indifference to many other instances of alleged sexual assaults was to blame for its careless disregard for the fundamental canons of journalism newspapers and magazines have slipped into the newspaper graveyard for less\\n\\nbecause of the sensitive nature of jackies story wrote will dana the managing editor we decided to honor her request not to contact the man she claimed participated in the attack for fear of retaliation against her facts have destroyed many a good story and the magazine didnt want that to happen to its account of jackies lurid tale\\n\\nin the face of new information the apology continued there now appear to be discrepancies in jackies account and we have come to the conclusion that our trust in her was misplaced it wasnt rolling stones fault it was jackies we were trying to be sensitive to the unfair shame and humiliation many women feel after a sexual assault and now regret the decision to not contact the alleged assaulters to get their account
